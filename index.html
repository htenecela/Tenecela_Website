                    <p>
                        I was born in Nyack, NY. At the age of 7, I flew to Ecuador with my family and finished my
                        education up to
                        high school. Shortly after graduating I decided to pursue my college education back in the US.
                        I started at Monroe Community College in Rochester, NY. Upon graduation, I transferred to
                        Cornell University to
                        continue my engineering studies. I am currently finishing my Master's of Engineering in
                        Mechanical Engineering.

                        My motivation to pursue engineering dates to my senior year in high school. I
                        was part of the IB program, and as a member I got the opportunity to travel around cities and
                        towns helping underserved communities
                        and assisting them with their basic needs. It was quite shocking that living conditions in
                        these communities were not the best, and education was rarely heard of. Ever since I graduated
                        from
                        high school and traveled to the US, I have aimed to gain experience in the engineering field to
                        one day come back and provide strategic plans to improve living conditions through housing and
                        educational technology.

                Set up and analyzed wind turbulence in the wake of a cylinder

                I have always enjoyed motivating and being able to help the future generation of professionals. I was
                able
                to work at a charter school in the city of Rochester, NY. Here, I would assist students in any
                assignment they would have.
                Primarily science and math related assignments.

                <p>
                    Our main goal was to first read from the ADC pins of the Pi Pico to get
                    the current voltage across the flex sensors. Then, we used linear mapping form
                    voltage to PWM, to then send this PWM signal to the servo motor. Since these PWM signals
                    control the rotational position of the servos, we can adjust the servo position using the flex
                    sensors.
                    A logical structure for the software implementation is shown below.

                <ul>
                    <p>
                        We used cardboard, straws, and strings to build the animatronic hand. We traced our hands on
                        the cardboard, then cut out the pattern with scissors. We hinged the finger joints with the
                        help of a knife to give a natural curl to the fingers. We attached one edge of the string to
                        the tip of the finger and the other to the servo motors. This setup will enable the fingers
                        to curl when the servo motor is activated. The straws helped us create a channel that would
                        later be used to feed the strings through. A better picture of the
                        setup is illustrated below.

                        <li>
                            The results of this project met our expectations. We successfully controlled our
                            custom-made
                            mechatronic hand with three flex sensors. We were able to perform simple gestures on the
                            mechatronic hands with the movement of our fingers. Because of linear mapping and
                            threshold
                            in our software, we could precisely control each fingers degree of movement.
                            The only setback of this project is that we only had three ADC pins on the Pi Pico, and
                            consequently we were able to only use three flex sensors.
                            If we want to make improvements, we could use a
                            microcontroller with five usable ADC pins so that each finger can control corresponding
                            fingers on the mechatronic hand. The other improvement we might want is to make this
                            control wireless so that we can control the mechatronic hand in different locations.

            <h1 class="popup_subtitle">Objective</h1>
            <p>
                As a design project we were assigned to choose a Reuleaux Machine from an online gallery. We
                would then observe this machine
                and all its components. Using our understanding of basic mechanics, we had to figure out how
                such machine worked and all components
                interacted. Finally, we would use Fusion 360 to design an accurate representation of chosen
                Reuleaux Machine. I chose the "Pappenheim Chamber
                Wheel Mechanism" which was manufactured by Gustave Voigt Werkstatt and
                designed by Reuleaux Franz.
            </p>
            <h1 class="popup_subtitle">About the Pappenheim Chamber Wheel Mechanism</h1>
            <p>
                This machine is the oldest form of chamber-wheel-gear, and the forerunner of modern gear pumps.
                The fluid that travels through the mechanism is delivered in a continuous stream. The volume of
                the flow per revolution is about equal to the annular space between the point and root
                cylinders.
                The mechanism can serve as both a pump and a motor. When water flows through the top entrance
                of the machine, the interlocked wheels can serve as a motor. On the other hand, when making use
                of the handle, it could allow the device to deliver fluids with constant volumetric flow. Below
                an image.

                I have always found fascinating the capability of capturing moments in life through pictures.
                I recently acquired a semi-professional camera (Sony alpha a6000) which I have been using ever
                since.

                At the age of 16 I was on a quest of finding a sport that I would be truly passionate about.
                After bouncing from sport to sport, including soccer, basketball, volleyball, track and field, etc.,
                I found myself enrolling in a jiu jitsu gym and have continued practicing ever since!
